# Calculator

Description: Calculate your mathemathical problems whenever you want to!

Difficulties:

1. The biggest difficuly was how to store a variable of the current and previous diplay
2. Adding functionality for every operator
3. Adding Keyboard Support
4. Updating the display after calculation
5. Creating functionality for calculation such that you can add multiple numbers at once

What I Learned from this Project:

1. How to handle EventListners
2. Making the calculator body with CSS GRID
3. Storing Values of multiple variable and updating them on the website

Features to Implement in the future:

1. Optimize and reduce the code size as little as possible
2. Adding custom animations
3. Adding New Operators
